                <h2>Earthquake</h2>
                <p>The Keichō earthquake occurred on 3 February, 1605 at approximately 8:00 PM, affecting the Nankai and Tōkai regions of Japan. The earthquake occurred on the Nankai megathrust between the Philippine Sea plate and the Eurasian plate. There is little information about its effects alone, and most of the damage caused was the result of the subsequent tsunami, despite the fact that the earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 7.9.</p>

                <h2>Tsunami</h2>
                <p>The resulting tsunami of the earthquake was far more damaging. Victims of the tsunami were reported on the southern coast of Japan from Kyushu to the Kii Peninsula. It has been noted that several castles were destroyed. As for casualties, it is uncertain due to competing records, but estimates put the numbers into the thousands.</p>

                        <p class="song-justify">"Flood I" is generally just one single guitar riff repeated over and over for 15 minutes, but this provides a very strong calming atmosphere as the reverb and delay on the guitar combines on itself to create a thick wall of sound. I think this can represent the movements of the Earth's mantle that will eventually culminate into an earthquake (a calm before the storm, in a sense). This more apparently takes form in the repeated drums that develop over the course of the sing, and it is seemingly recorded in a very open room as it has an incredible amount of reverb. As the track progresses, the drumming gets more dense and incomprehensible, so this could represents the beginnings of the earthquake.</p>

                        <p class="song-justify">The beginning to "(circle)" is strange and disjointed, but this could represent the human happenings across Japan as people do different things while the earthquake is brewing; when the music pauses, this could represent people realizing that an earthquake is happening. Then when the drums enter and the percussion becomes almost tribal, this can be seen as the true beginning of the earthquake and the panic that ensues. The length of the track (being about 14 minutes in length) adds to this sense of panic, as when something like an earthquake occurs, the panic can cause time to slow down as so many things are occurring, and people are trying to do so many things like saving their belongings.</p>

                        <p class="song-justify">This song continues the insane percussion in "(circle)", but this time it is even more disjointed. With how Injury Reserve manipulates the original song, the feeling that things are falling apart could be represented. By the end of the song though, things calm down, and in the outro, there are strange vocals that are nearly chorale-like. That could represent the mourning of what damages might have occurred, and it could also be the period of when the tsunami is developing.</p>

                        <p class="song-justify">"FLOWER GIRL" is essentially one large, continuous crescendo. Its singing and (initially) laid back instrumental come together to form a contemplative tone that could represent the slow formation of a tsunami out in the ocean as it moves closer to Japan. This feeling is exemplified as the song continues, but in the latter half, there is a short solo-vocal intermission before distorted guitars reenter the song. This break and new section could represent the tide pulling back and the true wave beginning to build. At the end of the song, it becomes quiet, and it could be this time that represents when people notice that a tsunami is about to hit.</p>

                        <p class="song-justify">Yes; this is another song on the same album as "Flood I," and as the title might suggest, the album thematically represents the events of a flood, but these two songs are more important to its story than some of the other parts due to their progression. In the beginning of "Flood III," it begins calm and slow like the first part. In the context of "FLOWER GIRL," this could represent the moments before the tsunami crashes on land while onlookers watch the wave tower over the coast. But with only some transition, the guitars become overdriven and distorted, creating a harsh tone; as they progress as such, it could represent the wave getting closer and closer. Then with the entrance of the heavy drums, it represents the moment when the wave finally contacts towns, buildings, and cities and when destruction begins. Over the course of the rest of the song, the heaviness slightly settles down, and you can imagine the water rolling over homes and other buildings, over farmland, and over everything made by humans.</p>

                        <p class="song-justify">As for "I Saw a Ray," it continues this theme of the tsunami's damage and aftermath. It begins with a low and distorted drone that lasts for the entire song, again representing the water running over the land. In addition, there are prolonged and soft vocals that evoke feelings of mourning and sadness, bringing the ideas of the tsunami's casualties into mind. The song ends with a fade out, showing that the water is finally settling.</p>
